## GAN-based Image Augmentation Generation via *DiscoFaceGAN*


This code is based on the official [DiscoFaceGAN](https://github.com/microsoft/DiscoFaceGAN) repository of the paper Disentangled and Controllable Face Image Generation via 3D Imitative-Contrastive Learning. Please strickly follow their licence (Licensed under the MIT license) and cite the corrosponding work.    



To generate images we recommend creating a virtual environment with *`requirementsTF.txt`*.  
Important: DiscoFaceGAN requires Tensorflow 1.12 (with GPU support)
